			<p align="justification">The meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of nirodha (mental control), then its goal is "the unqualified state of niruddha (the perfection of that process)",according to Baba Hari Dass. In that context, "yoga (union) implies duality (as in joining of two things or principles); the result of yoga is the nondual state", and "as the union of the lower self and higher Self. The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality; it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation.</p>

			<p align="justification">Patanjali's writing defined an Ashtanga or "Eight-Limbed" Yoga in Yoga Sutras 2.29. They are:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Yama (The five "abstentions"): Ahimsa (Non-violence, non-harming other living beings),Satya (truthfulness, non-falsehood),Asteya (non-stealing),Brahmacharya (celibacy, fidelity to one's partner),and Aparigraha (non-avarice, non-possessiveness)</li>
				<li>Niyama (The five "observances"): Śauca (purity, clearness of mind, speech and body),[150] Santosha (contentment, acceptance of others and of one's circumstances),Tapas (persistent meditation, perseverance, austerity),Svādhyāya (study of self, self-reflection, study of Vedas),and Ishvara-Pranidhana (contemplation of God/Supreme Being/True Self).</li>
				<li>Asana: Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation.</li>
				<li>Pranayama ("Breath exercises"): Prāna, breath, "āyāma", to "stretch, extend, restrain, stop".</li>
				<li>Pratyahara ("Abstraction"): Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects</li>
				<li>Dharana ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object.</li>
				<li>Dhyana ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation.</li>
				<li>Samadhi ("Liberation"): merging consciousness with the object of meditation.</li>
