		<p>Yoga is a great tool to help improve respiratory health and immunity, both of which are involved in the prevention and healing from COVID-19. Below are some resources to help boost immunity and respiratory health.</p>

		<h2>Bhramari Improves Immunity via Nitric Oxide Increase</h2>

		<p>The ATS journal, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, has published a research that says "Humming Greatly Increases Nasal Nitric Oxide". Results show: "Humming (low pitch Bhramari) caused a 15-fold increase (range, 8–21) in nasal Nitric Oxide compared with quiet exhalation".  Nitric Oxide has been recognized as the most versatile players in the immune system </p><a href="https://yogabharati.org/article-blog/bhramari-increases-immunity-through-nitric-oxide">Read More</a>

		<h2>Sun-Salutations and Boosting Immunity</h2>

		<p>Surya Namaskar (SN) or Sun Salutation is a series of 10 or 12 poses in a continuous flow, synchronizing breathing with body movement. If you practice only a little yoga each day, practice sun salutations. For people with limited time, sun salutations benefit most muscles and joints. One of the best energization techniques, Sun Salutation (SN) is a practice of stimulation and relaxation that emphasizes breath and body awareness. SN also improves spinal flexibility and results in improved immunity.</p><a href="https://yogabharati.org/article-blog/surya-namaskar-sun-salutations-for-immunity">Read More</a>

		<h2>Tips to Handle COVID-19 Outbreak - WHO </h2>

		<h3>Wash your hands frequently</h3>

		<p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them for 20 seconds with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>

		<h3>Maintain social distancing</h3>

		<p>Maintain at least 6 feet distance between yourself and others. Additionally, avoid non-essential outings at public places such as restaurants, bars and event venues.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Even for healthy individuals, social distancing is a vital tool to slow the spread of COVID-19. Young, generally healthy folks infected with the virus may have very mild cold symptoms or even be asymptomatic. It’s important for these populations to practice social distancing in order to protect vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.</p>

		<h3>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h3>

		<p>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>

		<h3>Practice respiratory hygiene</h3>

		<p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissues when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>

		<h3>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</h3>

		<p>Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

		Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

		Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading:

		Follow the guidelines outlined above.

		Stay at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache and slight runny nose, until you recover. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.

		If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. </p>
