        	<p>Yoga is an old discipline from India. It is both spiritual and physical. Yoga uses breathing techniques, exercise and meditation. It helps to improve health and happiness.

			Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union.

			Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga. He defined yoga as "the cessation of the modification of the mind". (stopping changing the 	mind).

			A person doing yoga will move from one posture (called asana) to another. For example, the "sun-salutation" contains 12 poses of asanas, one after the other, and is said to help balance body and soul. The "sun-salutation" is popularly known as "Suryanamaskar".</p>

		<div id="history">

			<p>Yoga was introduced by Indian Ascetic . Ascetic practices (tapas) are referenced in the Brāhmaṇas (900 to 500 BC), early commentaries on the Vedas.Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization (~3300–1700 B.C.) sites in Pakistan depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose. The pose shows "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga", according to archaeologist Gregory Possehl. Scholars think there must be some type of connection between the Indus Valley seals and later yoga and meditation practices, though there is no conclusive evidence.

			Jonathan Mark Kenoyer describes one figure as "seated in yogic position".
			Karel Werner writes that " Archeological discoveries allow us therefore to speculate with some justification that a wide range of Yoga activities was already known to the people of pre-Aryan India".</p>

			<p align="justification">The meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of nirodha (mental control), then its goal is "the unqualified state of niruddha (the perfection of that process)",according to Baba Hari Dass. In that context, "yoga (union) implies duality (as in joining of two things or principles); the result of yoga is the nondual state", and "as the union of the lower self and higher Self. The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality; it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation.</p>

			<p align="justification">Patanjali's writing defined an Ashtanga or "Eight-Limbed" Yoga in Yoga Sutras 2.29. They are:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Yama (The five "abstentions"): Ahimsa (Non-violence, non-harming other living beings),Satya (truthfulness, non-falsehood),Asteya (non-stealing),Brahmacharya (celibacy, fidelity to one's partner),and Aparigraha (non-avarice, non-possessiveness)</li>
				<li>Niyama (The five "observances"): Śauca (purity, clearness of mind, speech and body),[150] Santosha (contentment, acceptance of others and of one's circumstances),Tapas (persistent meditation, perseverance, austerity),Svādhyāya (study of self, self-reflection, study of Vedas),and Ishvara-Pranidhana (contemplation of God/Supreme Being/True Self).</li>
				<li>Asana: Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation.</li>
				<li>Pranayama ("Breath exercises"): Prāna, breath, "āyāma", to "stretch, extend, restrain, stop".</li>
				<li>Pratyahara ("Abstraction"): Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects</li>
				<li>Dharana ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object.</li>
				<li>Dhyana ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation.</li>
				<li>Samadhi ("Liberation"): merging consciousness with the object of meditation.</li>
